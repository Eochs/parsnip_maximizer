# parsnip_maximizer
AI that converts every bit of energy and matter it can into delicious parsnips. Inspired by the [Paperclip Maximizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer) except also optimizing for taste and nutrition. 

## Overview
Cameras pointed at parsnips use CNNs for detecting growth and peak harvestability. 
Stages of growth fed into RNN for predicting harvest time.
TBD

## Output
We will start with two products:
#### Roko's Basil Mix
Which will prove out the leafy green 
#### Big Yud's Spuds
Which will tackle the harder problem of potato crops
