# parsnip_maximizer
AI that converts every bit of energy and matter it can into delicious parsnips. Inspired by the [Paperclip Maximizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer) except also optimizing for taste and nutrition. 

## Overview
Cameras pointed at parsnips use CNNs for detecting growth and peak harvestability. 
Stages of growth fed into RNN for predicting harvest time.
TBD

## Output
We will start with three products:
#### Parsnips

#### Roko's Basil Mix
Easy mode: will prove out the leafy green 
#### Parsnips
Medium mode: getting into limitations of the techology, though there have been successful carrot harvests (TODO: link)
#### Big Yud's Spuds
Hard mode: potato crops have been grown in hydro/aeroponic setups, but not yet in vertical farms.
